<p>This is a company that pick up used furniture and household items. Their audience are often new homeowners, so a modern, sleek design was needed.</p>

<p>This also needed a very specific scheduling tool and form in order for customers to choose their pickup dates and for the company to handle these appointments (avoid double booking etc).</p>
