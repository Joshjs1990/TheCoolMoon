										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>



<p>I had the opportunity to design and develop the website for <em>Daun Harapan</em>, a documentary film centered on the Kratom industry. Using WordPress, the site was crafted to showcase the film’s message and the social, environmental, and economic impacts of the Kratom trade. The main goal was to create an engaging, user-friendly platform to promote the film, raise awareness about Kratom, and serve as an educational hub for those interested in the industry.</p>

<p>2. <strong>User Experience (UX) &amp; Interface:</strong></p>



<p>• <strong>Story-Driven Design:</strong> The homepage features bold visuals and immersive storytelling techniques, with video stills, trailers, and impactful images from the film. I used a layout that conveys the thematic elements of the film: community, nature, and the challenges surrounding the Kratom industry.</p>



<p>• <strong>Clear Navigation:</strong> The site offers easy access to information about the film, including a synopsis, director’s message, and details about the Kratom industry. This allows users to quickly explore and engage with the content.</p>

<p>• <strong>Call-to-Action Elements:</strong> Integrated features encourage visitors to subscribe to updates, donate to support future projects, and follow the film’s journey through social media. I added forms to capture email subscriptions and promote engagement with the film’s audience.</p>



<p>• <strong>Blog Section:</strong> A regularly updated blog highlights news related to the film, Kratom industry updates, and interviews with experts, driving organic traffic and keeping the audience informed.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Security &amp; Performance:</strong></p>



<p>• <strong>Security:</strong> Implemented security protocols such as SSL encryption, daily backups, and security plugins to protect the website’s content and data.</p>



<p>• <strong>Performance:</strong> Caching tools and media compression techniques were employed to ensure fast loading speeds, vital for user retention and SEO.</p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<p>• <strong>Engagement Boost:</strong> Since the launch, the <em>Daun Harapan</em> website has seen a rise in engagement, with viewers spending time on key areas such as the trailer, blog, and educational sections.</p>



<p>• <strong>SEO Performance:</strong> The website ranks for relevant search terms, including Kratom industry insights, Kratom documentary, and related keywords, driving organic traffic from both individuals curious about Kratom and environmental documentaries.</p>



<p>• <strong>Positive Audience Feedback:</strong> Visitors have commended the site for its streamlined design and informative content, which aligns with the film’s educational mission.</p>



<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
