<p>I had the opportunity to design and develop the website for <em>Daun Harapan</em>, a documentary film centered on the Kratom industry. Using WordPress, the site was crafted to showcase the film’s message and the social, environmental, and economic impacts of the Kratom trade. The main goal was to create an engaging, user-friendly platform to promote the film, raise awareness about Kratom, and serve as an educational hub for those interested in the industry.</p>

<p>• <strong>Call-to-Action Elements:</strong> Integrated features encourage visitors to subscribe to updates, donate to support future projects, and follow the film’s journey through social media. I added forms to capture email subscriptions and promote engagement with the film’s audience.</p>



<p>• <strong>Blog Section:</strong> A regularly updated blog highlights news related to the film, Kratom industry updates, and interviews with experts, driving organic traffic and keeping the audience informed.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Security &amp; Performance:</strong></p>



<p>• <strong>Security:</strong> Implemented security protocols such as SSL encryption, daily backups, and security plugins to protect the website’s content and data.</p>

<p>• <strong>SEO Performance:</strong> The website ranks for relevant search terms, including Kratom industry insights, Kratom documentary, and related keywords, driving organic traffic from both individuals curious about Kratom and environmental documentaries.</p>



<p>• <strong>Positive Audience Feedback:</strong> Visitors have commended the site for its streamlined design and informative content, which aligns with the film’s educational mission.</p>



<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>

<p>5. <strong>SEO and Performance Optimization</strong></p>



<p>I followed best practices for SEO by optimizing page speed, metadata, and keyword strategy to help the website rank higher in search engine results. Additionally, the website was designed for fast loading times to ensure users could access content quickly, even on slower mobile networks.</p>



<p>6. <strong>Content Strategy and Lead Generation</strong></p>



<p>I placed clear calls-to-action throughout the site, prompting users to request consultations, subscribe to updates, or get in touch with the team directly. I also enhanced the blog section to allow for regular posting of cybersecurity updates and insights, positioning Cyber Shepherd as a thought leader in the industry.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>



<p>• <strong>Custom Service Pages:</strong> Each of Cyber Shepherd’s key services had dedicated, well-organized pages featuring custom icons and visuals, making their complex services easier to understand.</p>



<p>• <strong>Educational Blog:</strong> I built an educational blog section where Cyber Shepherd could post industry insights and tips to establish themselves as authorities while boosting SEO performance.</p>
